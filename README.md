     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Electronic Circuits and Communication Fundamentals (CSC304) and Basic Electronics Lab (CSL302) are core subjects in the Second Year (Semester III) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. These courses establish the foundational understanding of semiconductor devices, amplifier circuits, and various modulation techniques crucial for developing hardware systems and communication interfaces.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key domains in electronic circuits and communication theory:

- **Semiconductor Devices**: P-type and N-type semiconductor physics, diode characteristics, and applications.
- **Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJT)**: Transistor fundamentals, biasing techniques, small-signal models, and hybrid parameters.
- **Field Effect Transistors (FET)**: JFET and MOSFET characteristics, biasing, and amplifier configurations.
- **Amplifiers and Oscillators**: Multi-stage amplifiers, power amplifiers (Class A, B, C), and feedback oscillators for signal generation.
- **Communication Fundamentals**: Principles of electromagnetic spectrum, noise analysis, and basic communication system blocks.
- **Amplitude Modulation (AM)**: Generation and detection of AM signals, including DSB-SC, SSB-SC, and VSB techniques.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, question papers, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As I progress in my career, I recognize that electronic circuit fundamentals remain essential for understanding hardware-software co-design, signal processing, and telecommunication systems. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental electronic and communication concepts.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through ECCF and Basic Electronics Lab.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.

## Basic Electronics Laboratory

The laboratory component (CSL302) focuses on the practical application of electronic circuit theories, providing hands-on experience with semiconductor devices and communication hardware.

> [!TIP]
> **Review Before Implementation**: Always simulate circuit designs using tools like LTSpice or Proteus before hardware assembly. This helps verify expected outputs and prevents component damage from incorrect connections.
